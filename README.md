### What I learned

-  Tinting an image
To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<figure>
  <img src="images/image-header-desktop.jpg" alt="A group of business women" />
</figure>
```
```scss
// <== shows lines that focus on tinting an image from my solution
figure {
        margin: 0;
        display: flex;
        width: 100%;
        background: $accent; // <==
        border-radius: 10px 10px 0 0;

        img {
            width: inherit;
            opacity: 0.7; // <==
            mix-blend-mode: multiply; // <== optional but a cool find
            border-radius: inherit;
        }
    }
```

### Continued development

The normal tinting from [resources](#useful-resources) tinted the image but it didnt look like the design. using:
```css
img {
  mix-blend-mode: multiply;
}
```
seemed to work. The video above taught me about the different blending modes in Photoshop and it translated well to css ðŸ˜….
